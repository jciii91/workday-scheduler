# Work Day Scheduler

### Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

- When the page loads, the current date is displayed at the top of the page.
- There are rows for typical business hours (9AM - 5PM). There is 1 row for each hour.
- The rows are color coded based on the current time. Gray rows represent past hours, red is the current hour, and green are upcoming hours. The app checks the time every 10 minutes.
- When a user clicks on the description box they may enter a description for an event. Clicking on the save icon at the end of a row will save the text entered.
- Any saved content will persist between reloads and sessions.
